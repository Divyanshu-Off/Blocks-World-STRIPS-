# Blocks-World-STRIPS-
The Blocks World is a planning problem where blocks are moved to a desired configuration. Using the STRIPS method, actions like *pickup*, *putdown*, and *stack* are defined with preconditions and effects. The goal is to find a sequence of actions that transform the initial state into the goal state.
